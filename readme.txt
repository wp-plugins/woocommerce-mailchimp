Simple and flexible MailChimp integration for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

WooCommerce MailChimp provides simple and flexible MailChimp integration for WooCommerce.

Automatically subscribe customers to a designated MailChimp list and, optionally, MailChimp interest groups upon order creation or order completion. This can be done quietly or based on the user's consent with several opt-in settings that support international opt-in laws.

### Features ###

#### WooCommerce Event Selection ####

- Subscribe customers to MailChimp after order creation
- Subscribe customers to MailChimp after order completion

#### Works with MailChimp Interest Groups ####

- Set one or more interest groups to add users to based on the selected MailChimp list.

#### Opt-In Settings ####

- MailChimp double opt-in support (control whether a double opt-in email is sent to the customer)
- Optionally, display an opt-in checkbox on the checkout page (this is required in some countries)
- Control the label displayed next to the opt-in checkbox
- Control whether or not the opt-in checkbox is checked or unchecked by default
- Control the placement of the opt-in checkbox on the checkout page (under billing info or order info)

#### Translation Support ####

- i18n ready with included woocommerce-mailchimp.pot file
- WPML support via wpml-config.xml

**Included Translations:**

- English (default)
- No other translations yet.

Thanks in advance for your help on any translation efforts!

#### Multisite ####

- All features should work for each blog in multisite installations.

== Installation ==

2. Enable the plugin from the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.

= Usage =

1. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Integration > MailChimp
2. First, enable the plugin and set your MailChimp API Key and hit save.
3. Select whether you want customers to be subscribed to your MailChimp list after order creation or order completion (there's a difference in WooCommerce).
4. Next, select your MailChimp list and set any interest group settings (optional) and hit save.
5. That's it, now customers who purchase products from your WooCommerce store will automatically be subscribed to the selected list (and optional interest groups) in MailChimp!
